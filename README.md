The project is basically of the Data Structure. Can be used as the project in the subject of the Data Structures as I did in my 3rd Sem, but believe me, every line of the code is written by myself.

Key Data structures: Linked List, Priority Queue, Hashmaps, etc.

The project mainly stores the number of matches played my the player and the date of each match along with the runs or the wickets accordng the role of the player in the team are stored.
And at last the runs or the wickets of the player are displayed in sorted order and also the date is displayed.
And the Batsman of the Season(BatS) and Bowler Of The Season(BowS) are also diaplayed.
